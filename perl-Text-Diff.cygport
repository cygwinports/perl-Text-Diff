NAME="perl-Text-Diff"
VERSION=1.41
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="Perl"
SUMMARY="Perl implementation of diff for text"
DESCRIPTION="Text::Diff provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff
utility. It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is
better integrated with Perl and available on all platforms. It is often faster
than shelling out to a system's diff executable for small files, and generally
slower on larger files."
